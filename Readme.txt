SystemInfoLib is a library written in C# that provides system/hardware information through .NET (just in case C# didn't tip you off there).

This does NOT use WMI, everything is done without the use of the System.Management class. Why? Mainly because in the future, hopefully I will get around to supporting Linux through Mono compatibility.



In terms of licensing, this is released under the WTFPL. Do what you want with it.

If you feel like being a bro, just fire me a message saying you're using it, its nice to know people find my work useful :)
